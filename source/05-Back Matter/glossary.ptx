      <term>Entropy</term>
      <definition>
        A quantitative measure of uncertainty or multiplicity in a system.
        In statistical mechanics, entropy is commonly defined as
        <m> S = k_B \ln \Omega </m>,
        where <m>\Omega</m> is the number of accessible microstates
        and <m>k_B</m> is Boltzmann’s constant.

      <term>Hamiltonian</term>
      <definition>
        The function that represents the total energy of a system expressed
        in generalized coordinates and conjugate momenta. It generates the
        equations of motion in Hamiltonian mechanics.

        For many classical systems:
        <me>
          H(q,p) = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q)
        </me>

        More generally, time evolution is governed by Hamilton’s equations:
        <me>
          \dot{q} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p},
          \qquad
          \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}.
