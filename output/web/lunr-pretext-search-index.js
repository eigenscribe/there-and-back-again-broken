This approach supports long-term maintenance and cross-referencing.    Citation Structure  PreTeXt supports structured citation management through bibliographies. Here's the recommended approach for longevity:   1. BiTeX Source File  Create a references.bib file in your source directory. Use standard BibTeX format for all citations:   Example BibTeX entries  @article{author2024title, author = {First Author and Second Author}, title = {Title of the Article}, journal = {Journal Name}, year = {2024}, volume = {10}, number = {3}, pages = {123--145}, doi = {10.xxxx\/xxxxx} } @book{authorYear, author = {Author Name}, title = {Book Title}, publisher = {Publisher Name}, year = {2024}, edition = {1st} } @misc{websiteAuthor2024, author = {Website Author}, title = {Title of Webpage}, url = {https:\/\/example.com}, year = {2024}, note = {Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD} }     2. In-Text Citations  Use the <cite> tag to reference entries from your bibliography:   In-text citation example  <p> According to recent research <cite bib=\"hestenes1993hamiltonian\" \/>, the approach works as follows... <\/p> <p> Multiple sources support this <cite bib=\"author2024title authorYear\" \/>. <\/p>     3. Bibliography Setup in docinfo.ptx  Add bibliography configuration to your docinfo.ptx file. Add this inside the <docinfo> element:   docinfo.ptx bibliography configuration  <!-- Near the end of docinfo, before closing tag --> <!-- Bibliography from external BibTeX file --> <xi:include href=\".\/references.bib\" parse=\"text\" \/> <!-- Or: if using publication.ptx --> <bibliography> <bibfile relative-to=\"source\" source=\"references.bib\" \/> <\/bibliography>      Citation Workflow   Capturing New Citations  When you encounter a source:   Extract full bibliographic information  Add entry to references.bib with a meaningful key  Use consistent naming: [firstName][Year][keyword]  Cite in text where relevant     Organizing Citations   By Category: You might organize your references.bib into sections:  % ========== PAPERS ========== @article{...} % ========== BOOKS ========== @book{...} % ========== WEBSITES\/MISC ========== @misc{...}   Linking to Field Notes: Cross-reference your Field Notes chapter where you summarize these sources:  <p> See <xref ref=\"sec-field-papers\" \/> for my summary of this paper. <\/p>     Best Practices for Long-Term Maintenance     Consistent Format: Stick to one style (APA, Chicago, IEEE—PreTeXt handles the rendering).     Meaningful Keys: Use keys that remind you of the source. smith2024neural is better than ref42 .     Complete Information: Include DOI, URL, or other persistent identifiers when available. This helps find sources years later.     Verification: Periodically verify that URLs still work and sources are correctly formatted.     Link to Notes: In Field Notes, always summarize the source and link back to where you cite it in Scribing.     Backup Citations: If a source is critical, consider archiving it (e.g., via Archive.org).

Use persistent identifiers: Include DOIs, ISBNs, and OCLC numbers when available.     Archive important sources: Use Archive.org to snapshot web pages and PDFs.     Maintain a local PDF library: For sources you cite frequently, keep local copies in a standardized location.     Document decision rationales: In Meta, explain why you chose certain sources and what makes them canonical.      "
